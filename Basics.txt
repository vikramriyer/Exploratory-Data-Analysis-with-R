Lesson 1
What is EDA?
- Initial step before a very large process of predictive modelleling
- Convert data in words to numbers, charts to understand it better

Just looking at the numerical data doesnt give any idea as such about the data,but when we convert the data into some statistical charts like histogram, bar charts etc, the data starts making more sense and is easy to understand;  which is the major task of EDA

Goals of EDA
Goal 1
understand a certain metric or relations between data points in the given data set

Goal 2
assess and validate the prediction on which the future inferences will be based

Goal 3
Which tools to use to show the data is also very important

Tip: Look at data with Curiosity but also with Skepticism :)
