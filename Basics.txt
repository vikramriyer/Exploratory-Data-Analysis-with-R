Lesson 1
What is EDA?
- Initial step before a very large process of predictive modelleling
- Convert data in words to numbers, charts to understand it better

Just looking at the numerical data doesnt give any idea as such about the data,but when we convert the data into some statistical charts like histogram, bar charts etc, the data starts making more sense and is easy to understand;  which is the major task of EDA

Goals of EDA
Goal 1
understand a certain metric or relations between data points in the given data set

Goal 2
assess and validate the prediction on which the future inferences will be based

Goal 3
Which tools to use to show the data is also very important

Tip: Look at data with Curiosity but also with Skepticism :)

Power of R
TPR FPR ROC AUC

Receiving Operating Characteristic, or ROC, is a visual way for inspecting the performance of a binary classifier (0/1). In particular, it's comparing the rate at which your classifier is making correct predictions (True Positives or TP) and the rate at which your classifier is making false alarms (False Positives or FP)

TPR = true positives/(true positives + false positives)
FPR = false positives/(true positives + false positives)

Working with R
demistifying.r

setting up R
setting up Rstudio

setwd('/path/to/working/dir') => similar to cd
getwd() => similar to pwd

states <- read.csv("~/vikram-code-school/ND/P4/datasets/stateData.csv")
head(states, 5) => top 5 rows
subset(states, state.region == 1) => gets all the records where region == 1
states[states$region == 1,] => this gets same result as above subset
